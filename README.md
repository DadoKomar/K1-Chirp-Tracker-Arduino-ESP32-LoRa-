# K1-Chirp-Tracker-Arduino-ESP32-LoRa-
DIY board with ESP32 S3, LoRa WAN, g Sensor, GPS ublox M10Q, 8 x extra IO pins for external sensors, 3V3 Switched power (100mA*), Deep Sleep 17uA + 24uA GPS

I have had this project with GPS tracking and LoRa network for many years and finally first version is here. Last year I did lot of testing and seems tracker (also simple remote DHT thermometer) works just fine. Got even 150km reach on LoRa. (hill to hill). 
Great consumption in Deep sleep - only 17 uA. With 350mAh battery can run for over 6 months with every 30 minutes LoRa trasnmit.
